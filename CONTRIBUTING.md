# Contributing to Rail Capture
:thumbsup: :tada: First of all, thanks! I love contributions! :tada: :thumbsup:

## Code Style
Please follow my code style as best you can (it might be a while before I implement a linter). This helps keep the code clean, readable and easy for others to understand. You do need to understand a project to contribute, correct?

## Browser Permissions
Please don't add any extra permissions to this, it really doesn't help me when I publish it on the addon stores (Chrome Webstore & Mozilla Addons), unless you specifically open an issue requesting it, and I approve the request. Your PR will be denied if you don't get my approval first.

## Running the App in Dev Mode
1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to the extensions page (Window → Extensions)
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…”
5. Select the folder for this app

That's about it, I can't wait to see what you add! :smile:
